# Hello!

The configuration for Drone is stored in a file called `.env`. Once you have made changes to it, you can restart the drone server by running `supervisorctl restart drone-server`.

To work with drone, you need to configure a provider in your `.env` file. See https://docs.drone.io/server/overview/ for instructions.
