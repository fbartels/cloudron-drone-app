# Hey there!

Configuration for drone is stored in the file called `.env`. After you have made changes to it you can restart just drone-server by running `supervisorctl restart drone-server`.

To work with drone you need to configure a provider in your `.env` file. See https://docs.drone.io/server/overview/ for instructions.
